Hi I'm Joey! I am a software engineer and a writer!

I am cofounding a startup with a bunch of great people on a web application
that is aiming to help large farming organizations adopt lean manufacturing
methodologies and make use of the data overflow currently hitting them! 
Check us out at [leaf (lean farming)](http://www.leaf.ag)!

I am a huge code nerd and aspiring polyglot. My passion is rapidly becoming Elixir + Phoenix. I currently work primarily
in AngularJS. So far I have dived into Ruby (Rails and Sinatra), Javascript (client and node), 
and skimmed the surface with Python.

One of my biggest dreams that I will work towards 
in the next year is to help foster a dev community in Phoenix that 
has the same tight-nit mentor mentality that I found during my time at DBC Chicago.
